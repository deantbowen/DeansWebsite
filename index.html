    <h1>
        Hey there, I'm Dean
    </h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a Cyber Security Analyst based in Cape Town, South Africa.
        In my line of work, I'm all about fighting malware and cyber intrusions. I work closely with network operations and system administrators to patch up vulnerabilities and beef up security across different networks and devices. My goal? 
        To keep critical digital assets safe and sound by setting up rock-solid defense mechanisms.
        I've completed some cool challenges like cracking hashes, mastering Metasploit, and even hacking into Windows systems.
        
        Moreover, I actively pursue certifications that bolster my expertise in cyber security, 
        each achievement serving as a testament to my commitment to staying at the forefront of this dynamic field.

    <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
    <p>
        This website is and always will be a work in progress, as my career advances.
        When I'm not busy locking down networks, you can find me exploring the cyber world on TryHackMe or HackTheBox platforms. 
        One of my passions lies in exploring the intricacies of cyber security through TryHackMe challenges, 
        where I continually push myself to conquer new feats in the digital realm.
            
               
        
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
            Below you will find a comprehensive list of Pentesting tools and a few demos I've documented of real hacks performed on my own machines/networks 
        (I gave myself permission).
            
        </p>

    THIS INFORMATION IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY! ALWAYS GET PERMISSION BEFORE PERFORMING ANY PENTESTING ON ANY MACHINE OR NETWORK.
