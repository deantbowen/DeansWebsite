        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
           I'm Dean, a Cyber Security Analyst based in Cape Town, South Africa.
            In my line of work, I'm all about fighting malware and cyber intrusions. I work closely with network operations and system administrators to patch up vulnerabilities and beef up security across different networks and devices. My goal? To keep critical digital assets safe and sound by setting up rock-solid defense mechanisms.

When I'm not busy locking down networks, you can find me exploring the cyber world on TryHackMe. I've completed some cool challenges like cracking hashes, mastering Metasploit, and even hacking into Windows systems.

In my downtime, I enjoy keeping up with the latest tech and sharing insights. If you're into IT, cyber security, AI or blockchain and want to connect, feel free to reach out here! --> www.linkedin.com/in/dtblin

Cheers,
Dean Bowen
